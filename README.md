## 🧐 Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>
Why?
The concept of time is a fundamental aspect of human existence, shaping our daily routines, relationships, and overall quality of life. As part of our university project, we have embarked on a comprehensive study to understand how individuals allocate their time across various activities, and with whom throughout their entire lifespan. By analyzing this data, we aim to gain insights into the patterns and trends that emerge, shedding light on the impact of culture, age, and societal changes on our time allocation.

Introduction
How people spend their time is something that tends to be unique to everyone, or so that is what we think. The reality is that not a single person spends their time the same way as anyone else yet there are large patterns and trends that can be seen not only across different regions of the world but also across cultures. Depending on the region or country one lives in drastically affects one's day to day life more than we think. Did you know that on average adults in Spain work only 2.9 hours a day while one in Japan works almost double that at 5.4 hours a day? Such a drastic change like this can be explained just by looking at the country one lives in. But why are there such changes? Why do those in the United States spend the least amount of time eating per day? Why are people feeling so lonely these days? All these questions have much more complex answers and their trends are explained by more than just one reason.  

## 💡 Goals / Solution <a name = "idea"></a> 
1. How people in different countries spend their time doing things:
We aim to analyze and compare the time allocation of individuals from various countries. We will collect data on various activities such as work, leisure, household chores, socializing, etc., and examine how people from different countries prioritize and distribute their time. This analysis will provide insights into cultural differences, lifestyle patterns, and societal norms across different regions.
2. Does different cultures affect our time use:
Understanding the influence of culture on individuals' time use. By examining data from diverse cultural backgrounds, we can identify how cultural factors such as values, traditions, and social norms impact how people allocate their time. This analysis will help us understand if cultural differences play a significant role in shaping individuals' time management strategies and activity choices.
3. With whom we spend our time depending on our age, how much time we spend lonely:
We aim to explore the relationship between age and social interactions. By analyzing data on individuals' age groups and their reported social interactions, we can determine how socialization patterns change across different age brackets. Additionally, we can investigate the prevalence of loneliness and its correlation with age, providing insights into the potential impact of social isolation on different age groups.
4. What is expected to happen in the future, how much time we will spend with others?
We aim to make predictions about future time use patterns and social interactions. By utilizing historical data and employing predictive modeling techniques, we can forecast how individuals' time allocation and socialization habits may evolve over time. This analysis can help anticipate potential shifts in societal dynamics and inform decision-making in areas such as resource allocation, social policies, and urban planning.


How we found our answers?
1. Analyze what we do with our time:
By examining how we allocate our time, we can identify patterns, prioritize tasks, and make necessary adjustments to optimize our daily routines. This analysis can involve tracking activities, categorizing them, and assessing the time spent on each. It helps us identify time-wasting activities, areas where we can delegate or automate tasks, and opportunities for personal growth or skill development.
2. With whom we spend this time: 
The people we choose to spend our time with greatly influence our happiness and success. Surrounding ourselves with positive, supportive individuals who share our values and aspirations can inspire us to reach new heights. By evaluating our social circle, we can ensure that we are investing our time in nurturing relationships that bring joy, encouragement, and personal growth.
3. Search for relationships in our data: 
Searching for relationships in our time data can uncover valuable insights about our habits and behaviors. By analyzing how certain activities or individuals impact our mood, productivity, and overall well-being, we can make informed decisions about how to structure our time. This data-driven approach enables us to identify positive relationships that contribute to our success and happiness, while also highlighting any negative influences that may be holding us back.
